# Problem Statement

Complete a partially filled 8x8 grid with numbers from 1 to 8, creating a valid Latin square that satisfies all additional constraints including adjacent pair sums, quadrant parity, and partial sums.

## Instance Data

**Pre-filled cells (1-indexed):**
- (1,1) = 1
- (1,8) = 8
- (2,2) = 6
- (3,3) = 4
- (4,4) = 5
- (5,5) = 7
- (6,6) = 4
- (7,7) = 6
- (8,8) = 3
- (8,1) = 8

## Constraints

1. **Latin Square Constraint**: Each row and each column must contain every number from 1 to 8 exactly once.

2. **Adjacent Pair Sum Constraint**: For every horizontally adjacent pair of cells in a row, their sum must be strictly greater than 5. Formally, `grid[r][c] + grid[r][c+1] > 5` for all valid row `r` and column `c`.

3. **Quadrant Parity Constraint**: The grid is divided into four 4x4 quadrants:
   - The **top-left** quadrant (rows 1-4, columns 1-4) must contain exactly 8 even numbers.
   - The **bottom-right** quadrant (rows 5-8, columns 5-8) must contain exactly 8 odd numbers.

4. **Partial Sum Constraint**:
   - The sum of the first four cells in row 1 must be exactly 14: `grid[1][1] + grid[1][2] + grid[1][3] + grid[1][4] = 14`
   - The sum of the first four cells in column 1 must be exactly 10: `grid[1][1] + grid[2][1] + grid[3][1] + grid[4][1] = 10`

## Objective

Fill all empty cells with numbers from 1 to 8 such that all four constraint sets are satisfied simultaneously.

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "grid": [
    [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8],
    [2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8, 1, 5],
    [3, 7, 4, 8, 1, 5, 2, 6],
    [4, 8, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7],
    [5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4],
    [6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 1],
    [7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 1, 6, 2],
    [8, 4, 5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3]
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **grid**: 8x8 array where `grid[i][j]` represents the number at row i+1, column j+1 (0-indexed in array, 1-indexed in problem description)
