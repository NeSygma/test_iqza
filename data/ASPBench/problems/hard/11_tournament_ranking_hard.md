# Problem Statement

Find a valid ranking for 30 teams in a weighted round-robin tournament with complex constraints. Each match has a positive integer weight. A violation occurs when a lower-ranked team beat a higher-ranked team. The task is to find a ranking that satisfies all hard constraints while keeping the total weighted violations within an acceptable bound.

## Instance Data

**Teams:** T01, T02, ..., T30

**Seeds (special teams):** T01, T02, T03, T04, T05, T06, T07, T08, T09, T10

**Groups:**
- Group A: T01-T05
- Group B: T06-T10
- Group C: T11-T15
- Group D: T16-T20
- Group E: T21-T25
- Group F: T26-T30

**Match Results:** Generated using the following pattern:
```python
import random
random.seed(42)
for i in range(30):
    for j in range(i+1, 30):
        weight = random.randint(1, 5)
        if (i+j) % 2 == 0:
            teams[i] beats teams[j] with weight
        else:
            teams[j] beats teams[i] with weight
```

## Constraints

1. **Must-above** constraints (20 pairs): T05 must rank above T18, T10 above T11, T07 above T28, T08 above T19, T02 above T27, T04 above T21, T03 above T12, T06 above T17, T09 above T25, T01 above T30, T13 above T29, T14 above T20, T15 above T16, T22 above T08, T23 above T03, T24 above T07, T26 above T05, T25 above T14, T20 above T22, T28 above T15

2. **Adjacency bans** (15 pairs): The following teams cannot be adjacent in ranking: (T02,T03), (T04,T05), (T06,T07), (T08,T09), (T10,T11), (T12,T13), (T14,T15), (T16,T17), (T18,T19), (T20,T21), (T22,T23), (T24,T25), (T26,T27), (T28,T29), (T01,T30)

3. **Forbid-top** constraints (8 teams): T27 cannot be in top 3, T14 in top 5, T18 in top 4, T21 in top 2, T22 in top 6, T19 in top 8, T16 in top 7, T29 in top 10

4. **Forbid-block** constraints (5 teams): T14 cannot be in positions 11-15, T20 in positions 5-9, T23 in positions 13-17, T02 in positions 21-25, T09 in positions 26-30

5. **Diversity** constraint: In any consecutive window of 5 teams, no more than 2 teams from the same group

6. **Seed quota**: At least 6 seed teams (T01-T10) must be in the top 10 positions

7. **Violation bound**: Total weighted violations must be ≤ 650, where a violation occurs when a lower-ranked team beat a higher-ranked team

## Objective

Find **any** valid ranking that satisfies all 7 constraints above. This is a **satisfaction problem**, not an optimization problem. The goal is to find a feasible ranking that meets the violation bound, not to find the ranking with the absolute minimum violations. Your solution will be considered correct if it respects all hard constraints (must-above, adjacency bans, forbid-top, forbid-block, diversity, seed quota) AND has total weighted violations ≤ 650.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "ranking": ["T01", "T02", ..., "T30"],
  "violations": 42,
  "valid": true,
  "total_abs_deviation": 15
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **ranking**: List of 30 team IDs in order from rank 1 to rank 30
- **violations**: Total sum of weights for all violations in this ranking
- **valid**: Boolean indicating whether all hard constraints are satisfied
- **total_abs_deviation**: Sum of absolute differences between each team's rank and its expected position (T01 expected at position 1, T02 at position 2, etc.)
