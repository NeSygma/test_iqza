# Problem Statement

Find a minimum cost vertex cover for an undirected graph with weighted vertices, standard edges, heavy edges with special coverage rules, master vertices with exceptional powers, and antagonistic pairs that cannot both be selected.

## Instance Data

**Vertices:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

**Vertex Costs:**
- High-cost vertices (cost 3 each): 2, 10, 14
- All other vertices (cost 1 each): 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15

**Standard Edges:**
- (1,3), (1,4), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8), (5,11), (6,7), (7,12), (8,12), (11,13), (12,13), (13,14)

**Heavy Edges:**
- (0,5), (9,10), (14,15)

**Master Vertices:** 0, 15

**Antagonistic Pairs:** (1,2), (8,9)

## Constraints

1. **Standard Edge Coverage:** Every standard edge (u, v) **must** be covered by selecting **at least one** of its endpoints (u or v, or both).

2. **Heavy Edge Coverage:** Every heavy edge (u, v) **must** be covered, but the coverage rule is more complex:
   - **General Rule:** A heavy edge is covered if **both** its endpoints (u AND v) are selected.
   - **Master Vertex Exception:** If a heavy edge has a master vertex (0 or 15) as an endpoint, selecting **only the master vertex** is sufficient to cover the edge. Note: For heavy edge (0,5), you can either select {0,5} (both endpoints) OR just {0} (master only) to cover it. Selecting only {5} without {0} does **not** cover it.

3. **Antagonistic Pairs:** For each antagonistic pair (u, v), **at most one** vertex can be selected. You **cannot** select both vertices from the same pair.

## Objective

Find a valid vertex cover that satisfies all constraints and **minimizes** the total cost (sum of costs of selected vertices).

**Expected optimal total cost: 12**

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "vertex_cover": [0, 3, 5, ...],
  "total_cost": 12
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `vertex_cover`: Array of integers representing the selected vertices (sorted order recommended)
- `total_cost`: Integer representing the sum of costs of all selected vertices
