# Problem Statement

Schedule 8 courses into 4 rooms across 6 time slots while satisfying teacher availability, room capacity, special room features, course prerequisites, student enrollment conflicts, and a global evening limit. The schedule should minimize departmental course clustering.

## Instance Data

**Courses** (ID, Name, Teacher, Students, Department):
- 0: Physics I (Teacher 0, 30 students, sci)
- 1: Physics II (Teacher 0, 25 students, sci)
- 2: Chemistry (Teacher 1, 40 students, sci)
- 3: History (Teacher 2, 50 students, hum)
- 4: Literature (Teacher 3, 45 students, hum)
- 5: Intro Programming (Teacher 4, 60 students, eng)
- 6: Data Structures (Teacher 4, 55 students, eng)
- 7: Algorithms (Teacher 4, 50 students, eng)

**Rooms** (ID, Capacity, Features):
- 0: 60 capacity, [projector]
- 1: 50 capacity, [projector]
- 2: 40 capacity, [lab, projector]
- 3: 30 capacity, []

**Time Slots**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Teacher Availability**:
- Teacher 0: slots [0, 1, 2]
- Teacher 1: slots [2, 3, 4]
- Teacher 2: slots [0, 1, 4, 5]
- Teacher 3: slots [0, 2, 3, 5]
- Teacher 4: slots [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Room Requirements**:
- Course 2 (Chemistry) requires: lab
- Courses 5, 6, 7 (all eng department) require: projector

**Prerequisites** (must be scheduled strictly before):
- Course 0 (Physics I) before Course 1 (Physics II)
- Course 5 (Intro Programming) before Course 6 (Data Structures)
- Course 6 (Data Structures) before Course 7 (Algorithms)

**Student Conflicts** (cannot be at same time):
- Courses 1 and 4 (Physics II and Literature)
- Courses 2 and 5 (Chemistry and Intro Programming)

## Constraints

1. **Unique Assignment**: Each course must be scheduled in exactly one room and one time slot.
2. **Room Uniqueness**: A room cannot be used for more than one course at the same time.
3. **Teacher Uniqueness**: A teacher cannot teach more than one course at the same time.
4. **Room Capacity**: A course cannot be scheduled in a room if the number of students exceeds the room's capacity.
5. **Teacher Availability**: A course can only be scheduled in a time slot if its assigned teacher is available.
6. **Room Features**: Courses requiring specific features must be scheduled in rooms with those features.
7. **Course Prerequisites**: Prerequisite courses must be scheduled in earlier time slots than dependent courses.
8. **Student Conflicts**: Courses with student conflicts cannot be scheduled at the same time.
9. **Global Evening Limit**: A maximum of 2 courses can be scheduled in time slot 5.

## Objective

Find a valid assignment of courses to (room, time_slot) pairs that satisfies all constraints and **minimizes** the number of adjacent same-department course pairs (courses from the same department scheduled in consecutive time slots).

**Expected optimal cost: 0**

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "cost": 0,
  "assignments": [
    {"course": 0, "room": 1, "time_slot": 0},
    {"course": 1, "room": 3, "time_slot": 2},
    {"course": 2, "room": 2, "time_slot": 2},
    {"course": 3, "room": 0, "time_slot": 4},
    {"course": 4, "room": 1, "time_slot": 3},
    {"course": 5, "room": 0, "time_slot": 1},
    {"course": 6, "room": 0, "time_slot": 3},
    {"course": 7, "room": 1, "time_slot": 5}
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `cost`: Integer value representing the number of adjacent same-department course pairs
- `assignments`: Array of assignment objects, each containing:
  - `course`: Course ID (0-7)
  - `room`: Room ID (0-3)
  - `time_slot`: Time slot (0-5)
