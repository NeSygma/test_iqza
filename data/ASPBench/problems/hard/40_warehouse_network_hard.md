# Problem Statement

Design an optimal distribution network by selecting which central hubs and regional warehouses to open. Assign customers to regional warehouses for delivery within specific time windows, respecting the supply chain's capacity, resource, and operational constraints.

## Instance Data

### Facilities and Time Slots
- **Hubs (2):** H1, H2
- **Regional Warehouses (4):** R1, R2, R3, R4
- **Customers (6):** C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6
- **Time Slots (4):** 1, 2, 3, 4

### Opening Costs
**Hubs:**
- H1: 1000
- H2: 1200

**Regional Warehouses:**
- R1: 200
- R2: 250
- R3: 220
- R4: 180

### Capacities
**Hubs:**
- H1: 400 units
- H2: 350 units

**Regional Warehouses:**
- R1: 70 units
- R2: 80 units
- R3: 60 units
- R4: 90 units

### Truck Resources
**Available trucks per hub (per time slot):**
- H1: 2 trucks
- H2: 1 truck

### Customer Demands and Time Windows
| Customer | Demand | Time Window |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| C1 | 20 | [2, 3] |
| C2 | 30 | [1, 2] |
| C3 | 15 | [3, 4] |
| C4 | 25 | [1, 4] |
| C5 | 35 | [2, 4] |
| C6 | 10 | [1, 1] |

### Transportation Costs (per unit of demand)
**Hub to Regional Warehouse:**
- H1 → R1: 5
- H1 → R2: 6
- H2 → R3: 5
- H2 → R4: 6

**Regional Warehouse to Customer:**
- R1 → C1: 10
- R1 → C2: 12
- R2 → C2: 13
- R2 → C3: 15
- R3 → C4: 9
- R3 → C5: 11
- R4 → C5: 14
- R4 → C6: 7

### Connectivity Constraints
**Hub can supply Regional Warehouse:**
- H1: R1, R2
- H2: R3, R4

**Regional Warehouse can serve Customer:**
- R1: C1, C2
- R2: C2, C3
- R3: C4, C5
- R4: C5, C6

### Maintenance Schedules
**Facilities unavailable during specific time slots:**
- R2 unavailable at time slot 2
- H1 unavailable at time slot 4

## Constraints

1. **Opening prerequisite:** A customer can only be served by an **open regional warehouse**, which must be supplied by an **open hub**
2. **Assignment uniqueness:** Each customer must be assigned to exactly **one regional warehouse** at exactly **one time slot**
3. **Supply uniqueness:** Each open regional warehouse must be supplied by exactly **one hub**
4. **Connectivity:** Hub-to-Regional and Regional-to-Customer assignments must respect the **connectivity constraints**
5. **Time windows:** Customer deliveries must occur within their specified **time windows**
6. **Maintenance:** No deliveries can pass through facilities during their **maintenance time slots**
7. **Regional capacity:** Total demand served by each regional warehouse cannot exceed its **capacity**
8. **Hub capacity:** Total demand passing through each hub (sum of demands at all supplied regional warehouses) cannot exceed hub **capacity**
9. **Truck limits:** Number of customer deliveries in each time slot from regional warehouses supplied by a hub cannot exceed the hub's available **trucks** for that time slot

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes total cost**, where:

**Total Cost** = Fixed opening costs + Hub-to-Regional transport costs + Regional-to-Customer transport costs

Where:
- Fixed opening costs = sum of opening costs for all opened hubs and regional warehouses
- Hub-to-Regional transport costs = sum over all supply links of (regional warehouse's total demand × hub-to-regional unit cost)
- Regional-to-Customer transport costs = sum over all deliveries of (customer demand × regional-to-customer unit cost)

**Expected minimum total cost: 5215**

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "open_hubs": ["H1", "H2"],
  "open_regionals": ["R1", "R2", "R3", "R4"],
  "hub_assignments": {
    "R1": "H1",
    "R2": "H1",
    "R3": "H2",
    "R4": "H2"
  },
  "customer_deliveries": [
    {
      "customer": "C1",
      "regional_warehouse": "R1",
      "time_slot": 2
    },
    {
      "customer": "C2",
      "regional_warehouse": "R1",
      "time_slot": 1
    },
    {
      "customer": "C3",
      "regional_warehouse": "R2",
      "time_slot": 3
    },
    {
      "customer": "C4",
      "regional_warehouse": "R3",
      "time_slot": 1
    },
    {
      "customer": "C5",
      "regional_warehouse": "R4",
      "time_slot": 2
    },
    {
      "customer": "C6",
      "regional_warehouse": "R4",
      "time_slot": 1
    }
  ],
  "total_cost": 5215
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `open_hubs`: List of hub identifiers that are opened in the solution
- `open_regionals`: List of regional warehouse identifiers that are opened
- `hub_assignments`: Mapping from regional warehouse to its supplying hub
- `customer_deliveries`: List of delivery assignments, each with customer ID, assigned regional warehouse, and delivery time slot
- `total_cost`: Total cost of the solution (should equal 5215 for optimal solution)
