# Problem Statement

Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 4 disks and 4 pegs where every disk must visit intermediate pegs B and C during its journey from source peg A to destination peg D. The goal is to transfer all disks from peg A to peg D in the minimum number of moves while satisfying the standard Tower of Hanoi rules and the mandatory journey constraint.

## Instance Data

**Disks**: 4 disks numbered 1 to 4 (disk 1 is smallest, disk 4 is largest)

**Pegs**: 4 pegs labeled A, B, C, D

**Initial State**:
- Peg A: [4, 3, 2, 1] (disk 4 at bottom, disk 1 on top)
- Peg B: empty
- Peg C: empty
- Peg D: empty

**Goal State**:
- Peg A: empty
- Peg B: empty
- Peg C: empty
- Peg D: [4, 3, 2, 1] (disk 4 at bottom, disk 1 on top)

## Constraints

1. **Standard Movement**: Only the top disk on a peg can be moved to another peg.

2. **Larger on Smaller**: A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

3. **Single Disk Move**: Exactly one disk is moved at each step.

4. **Pilgrim's Journey**: Every disk must land on peg B at least once AND land on peg C at least once during the sequence of moves. A disk "lands on" a peg when it is moved to that peg (i.e., the peg is the destination of a move).

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total number of moves to transfer all disks from peg A to peg D while satisfying all constraints.

**Expected optimal moves: 19**

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "moves": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "disk": 1,
      "from_peg": "A",
      "to_peg": "B"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "disk": 2,
      "from_peg": "A",
      "to_peg": "C"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total_moves": 19
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `moves`: Array of move objects ordered by step number
- `total_moves`: Integer representing the total number of moves in the sequence
- `step`: The move number, starting from 1
- `disk`: The integer identifier of the disk being moved (1-4)
- `from_peg`: The source peg ("A", "B", "C", or "D")
- `to_peg`: The destination peg ("A", "B", "C", or "D")
