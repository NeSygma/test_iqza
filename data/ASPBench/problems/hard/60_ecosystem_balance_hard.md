# Problem Statement

Model a dynamic ecosystem with 4 species distributed across 2 zones and 2 seasons. Find a stable population level for each of the 16 possible states (4 species × 2 zones × 2 seasons) that satisfies strict ecological constraints. Each species in each location has a discrete population level: none (0), medium (1), or high (2).

## Instance Data

**Species:** Grass, Rabbits, Foxes, Hawks

**Zones:** Forest, Meadow

**Seasons:** Summer, Winter

**Population Levels:** 0 (none), 1 (medium), 2 (high)

**Predator-Prey Relationships:**
- Rabbits eat Grass
- Foxes eat Rabbits
- Hawks eat Foxes

## Constraints

1. **Carrying Capacity:**
   - Grass has a **max level of 1** in the Forest
   - Foxes have a **level of 0** in the Meadow
   - Hawks have a **max level of 1** everywhere

2. **Winter Scarcity:**
   - Grass has a **max level of 1** in Winter
   - Rabbits **cannot have a high (2) level** in Winter

3. **Predator-Prey Balance:** In any given location (zone, season), a predator's population level **cannot be strictly greater** than its prey's level:
   - level(Rabbits) ≤ level(Grass)
   - level(Foxes) ≤ level(Rabbits)
   - level(Hawks) ≤ level(Foxes)

4. **Biodiversity:** The total population (sum of levels across all states) for each species **must be at least 1** to avoid extinction

5. **Hawk Population:** The total population level for Hawks **must be exactly 2**

## Objective

Find any valid solution that satisfies all constraints.

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

**Field Descriptions:**
- `population_levels`: Array of 16 objects, each specifying species, zone, season, and level (0-2)
- `predator_prey_relationships`: Array of predator-prey pairs defining the food chain
- `balance_achieved`: Boolean indicating if ecosystem balance is achieved (should be true for valid solutions)
