# Problem Statement

Given a weighted undirected graph with 16 vertices, partition the vertices into 4 equal-sized sets (4 vertices each) to minimize the total weight of edges crossing between partitions.

## Instance Data

**Vertices:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

**Edges (u, v, weight):**

Cluster 1 (vertices 0-3):
- (0, 1, 10), (0, 2, 10), (0, 3, 10)
- (1, 2, 10), (1, 3, 10)
- (2, 3, 10)

Cluster 2 (vertices 4-7):
- (4, 5, 10), (4, 6, 10), (4, 7, 10)
- (5, 6, 10), (5, 7, 10)
- (6, 7, 10)

Cluster 3 (vertices 8-11):
- (8, 9, 10), (8, 10, 10), (8, 11, 10)
- (9, 10, 10), (9, 11, 10)
- (10, 11, 10)

Cluster 4 (vertices 12-15):
- (12, 13, 10), (12, 14, 10), (12, 15, 10)
- (13, 14, 10), (13, 15, 10)
- (14, 15, 10)

Inter-cluster edges:
- (3, 4, 1), (7, 8, 2), (11, 12, 3), (15, 0, 1)
- (1, 6, 2), (5, 10, 3), (9, 14, 1)

## Constraints

1. **Partition count**: Exactly 4 partitions
2. **Balanced partitions**: Each partition must contain exactly 4 vertices
3. **Complete coverage**: Every vertex must be assigned to exactly one partition
4. **Disjoint sets**: No vertex can appear in multiple partitions

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total weight of edges crossing between partitions (cut weight).

**Expected minimum cut weight:** 13

## Output Format

```json
{
  "partition_1": [0, 1, 2, 3],
  "partition_2": [4, 5, 6, 7],
  "partition_3": [8, 9, 10, 11],
  "partition_4": [12, 13, 14, 15],
  "cut_weight": 13,
  "cut_edges": [
    {"from": 3, "to": 4, "weight": 1},
    {"from": 7, "to": 8, "weight": 2},
    ...
  ],
  "balance": {
    "is_balanced": true,
    "partition_1_size": 4,
    "partition_2_size": 4,
    "partition_3_size": 4,
    "partition_4_size": 4
  }
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `partition_1` through `partition_4`: Lists of vertex IDs assigned to each partition
- `cut_weight`: Integer sum of weights of all edges with endpoints in different partitions
- `cut_edges`: List of edges crossing partition boundaries
- `balance`: Partition size information confirming balanced distribution
