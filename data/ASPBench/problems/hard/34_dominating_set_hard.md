# Problem Statement

Find an **independent dominating set** with minimum total cost in a graph with vertices of different types, each with unique domination requirements. An **independent set** is a set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent. A **dominating set** must satisfy type-specific rules.

## Instance Data

**Graph:** 18 vertices (1-18)

**Edges:**
```
(1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,9), (4,5), (4,18),
(6,7), (6,9), (6,10), (7,9), (8,9), (8,14), (9,10), (11,12), (11,14),
(12,14), (13,14), (13,17), (15,16), (15,17), (16,17), (17,18)
```

**Vertex Types:**
- **Critical ('c'):** vertices 1, 5, 10, 15
- **Standard ('s'):** vertices 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 16
- **Resilient ('r'):** vertices 3, 8, 13, 18

**Vertex Costs:**
- Cost 2: vertices 4, 9
- Cost 3: vertices 14, 17
- Cost 5: vertices 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Cost 8: vertices 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18

## Constraints

1. **Independent Set:** No two vertices in the dominating set can be adjacent
2. **Critical vertices ('c'):** Must be adjacent to at least **one** vertex in the dominating set (if not in the set themselves)
3. **Standard vertices ('s'):** Must be adjacent to at least **one** vertex in the dominating set (if not in the set themselves)
4. **Resilient vertices ('r'):** Must be adjacent to at least **two** distinct vertices in the dominating set (if not in the set themselves)
5. All vertices must be dominated (either in the set or meeting their type's adjacency requirement)

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total cost of the dominating set.

**Expected minimum cost: 10**

## Output Format

```json
{
  "dominating_set": [4, 9, 14, 17],
  "total_cost": 10
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `dominating_set`: Array of vertex numbers in the dominating set (sorted)
- `total_cost`: Integer representing the sum of costs of selected vertices
