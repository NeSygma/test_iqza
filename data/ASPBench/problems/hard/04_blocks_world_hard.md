# Problem Statement

Transform stacks of weighted blocks from an initial configuration to a goal configuration by moving blocks one at a time while respecting weight and structural constraints.

## Instance Data

**Blocks:** 12 blocks labeled A through L

**Weights:**
- A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12

**Initial Configuration** (three stacks of height 4):
- Stack 1: D on table, C on D, B on C, A on B
- Stack 2: H on table, G on H, F on G, E on F
- Stack 3: L on table, K on L, J on K, I on J

**Goal Configuration** (three stacks of height 4):
- Tower 1: L on table, I on L, F on I, C on F
- Tower 2: K on table, H on K, E on H, B on E
- Tower 3: J on table, G on J, D on G, A on D

## Constraints

1. **Clear block**: Only blocks with nothing on top can be moved
2. **Single move**: Only one move occurs per time step
3. **Weight constraint**: A heavier block **cannot** be placed on a lighter block (weight(Y) >= weight(X) required for placing X on Y)
4. **Table limit**: **At most** 6 blocks may be directly on the table at any time
5. **Height limit**: **No** tower may exceed height 5 (depth 1 = directly on table)
6. **Valid positions**: Blocks can be placed on the table or on top of another clear block
7. **Distinct positions**: Source and destination **must** differ; block **cannot** be placed on itself
8. **Maximum Plan Length**: Your final plan must not exceed 50 moves.

## Objective

Your goal is to find a valid sequence of moves to transform the initial configuration into the goal configuration.

For this problem, the primary objective is finding a correct plan that respects all constraints. The complexity of the task suggests that a solution may require a significant number of moves, so you should ensure your search explores plans up to the **maximum allowed length of 50 moves**.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "plan_length": <number_of_actions>,
  "actions": [
    {
      "step": <integer>,
      "action": "move",
      "block": "<block_name>",
      "from": "<source_position>",
      "to": "<target_position>"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `plan_length`: Total number of moves in the plan
- `actions`: List of move actions in execution order
- `step`: Sequential step number (1, 2, 3, ...)
- `action`: Always "move" for this problem
- `block`: Single letter A-L (uppercase)
- `from`: Source position - either "table" or a block name (A-L)
- `to`: Target position - either "table" or a block name (A-L)

**Example Action:**
```json
{
  "step": 1,
  "action": "move",
  "block": "A",
  "from": "B",
  "to": "table"
}
```
