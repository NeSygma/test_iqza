# Problem Statement

A logistics company needs to open facilities to serve customers across a region. The goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes facility opening costs and service costs based on distances.

## Instance Data

**Customers (8 total):**
- Customer 1: (1, 1)
- Customer 2: (2, 4)
- Customer 3: (4, 2)
- Customer 4: (5, 5)
- Customer 5: (7, 1)
- Customer 6: (8, 3)
- Customer 7: (3, 6)
- Customer 8: (6, 4)

**Potential Facilities (5 total):**
- Facility A: (2, 2), Opening cost: 100
- Facility B: (4, 4), Opening cost: 120
- Facility C: (6, 2), Opening cost: 110
- Facility D: (3, 5), Opening cost: 90
- Facility E: (7, 3), Opening cost: 130

**Parameters:**
- Coverage radius: 3 (Manhattan distance)
- Service cost: 5 per unit distance

Manhattan distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.

## Constraints

1. **Each** customer must be served by at least one facility
2. A facility **can only** serve customers within its coverage radius (distance ≤ 3)
3. Facilities **can only** serve customers if they are opened
4. Service cost = Manhattan distance × 5

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total cost (sum of facility opening costs + sum of service costs).

**Expected optimal cost: 380**

## Output Format

```json
{
  "facilities": ["A", "B", ...],
  "assignments": {
    "1": "A",
    "2": "B",
    ...
  },
  "total_cost": 380,
  "feasible": true
}
```

**Fields:**
- `facilities`: List of opened facility IDs (letters A-E)
- `assignments`: Object mapping customer ID (string) to serving facility ID (letter)
- `total_cost`: Total cost (opening costs + service costs)
- `feasible`: Boolean indicating if solution is valid
