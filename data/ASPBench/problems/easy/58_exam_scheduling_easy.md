# Problem Statement

Schedule exams across multiple time slots and rooms while avoiding conflicts for students enrolled in multiple exams. Each room has limited capacity and all exams must be assigned to valid slots.

## Instance Data

**Exams:** E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6

**Students and Enrollments:**
- S1: E1, E3, E5
- S2: E1, E4, E6
- S3: E2, E3, E6
- S4: E2, E4, E5

**Time Slots:** 3 slots available (can be assigned day and slot combinations)

**Rooms:**
- R1: capacity 3 students
- R2: capacity 3 students

## Constraints

1. **All exams scheduled**: Every exam must be assigned to exactly one time slot and room
2. **No student conflicts**: A student **cannot** have two exams scheduled at the same time slot
3. **Room capacity**: The number of students in an exam **must not exceed** the room capacity
4. **Unique assignments**: Each exam appears exactly once in the schedule

## Objective

Find a valid schedule that assigns all exams to time slots and rooms without conflicts.
