# Problem Statement

Generate an 8-note melody in C major scale following basic harmonic rules and voice leading constraints. The melody should have good interval relationships and avoid forbidden progressions.

## Instance Data

- **Scale**: C major (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)
- **Melody length**: 8 notes
- **Starting note**: C
- **Ending note**: C

## Constraints

1. **All notes** must be from the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)
2. **Start and end** on tonic (C)
3. **No large leaps** greater than 4 semitones
4. Intervals must be calculated as semitone differences between consecutive notes

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "melody": ["C", "D", ..., "C"],
  "intervals": [2, 2, ...],
  "analysis": {
    "key": "C_major",
    "total_steps": 8,
    "leap_count": 1,
    "direction_changes": 3,
    "final_resolution": true
  }
}
```

Where:
- `melody`: List of 8 note names from C major scale
- `intervals`: List of 7 semitone intervals between consecutive notes
- `analysis.key`: Always "C_major"
- `analysis.total_steps`: Number of notes (always 8)
- `analysis.leap_count`: Count of intervals larger than 2 semitones
- `analysis.direction_changes`: Number of times melodic direction changes
- `analysis.final_resolution`: Boolean indicating if melody ends on tonic
