# Problem Statement

Schedule a double round-robin tournament for 4 teams where each pair plays exactly twice (once at each team's home venue) across 6 rounds, while minimizing total travel distance.

## Instance Data

**Teams and Locations:**
- Team A: (0, 0)
- Team B: (3, 4)
- Team C: (6, 0)
- Team D: (2, 8)

**Distance Matrix (Euclidean):**
```
     A    B    C    D
A    0    5    6   8.2
B    5    0    5   5.7
C    6    5    0   10
D  8.2  5.7   10   0
```

**Tournament Structure:**
- 6 rounds total
- 2 matches per round (4 teams = 2 simultaneous matches)
- 12 total matches (each pair plays twice with home/away swapped)

**Travel Model:**
Teams travel from their home city to opponent's city for away games. Teams return home after each round.

## Constraints

1. **Double round-robin**: Each pair of teams plays **exactly** twice (once home, once away)
2. **Round structure**: Each round has **exactly** 2 matches
3. **Team availability**: Each team plays **exactly** once per round
4. **Consecutive limit**: **No** team plays more than 2 consecutive home games
5. **Consecutive limit**: **No** team plays more than 2 consecutive away games

## Objective

Find a schedule that **minimizes** total travel distance for all teams across all rounds.

**Expected optimal total distance: 75**

## Output Format

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    [{"home": "A", "away": "B"}, ...],
    ...
  ],
  "total_distance": 75,
  "feasible": true
}
```

Where:
- `schedule`: List of 6 rounds, each containing 2 match objects
- Each match: `{"home": "X", "away": "Y"}` where team X hosts team Y
- `total_distance`: Integer sum of all away team travel distances
- `feasible`: Boolean indicating if all constraints are satisfied
