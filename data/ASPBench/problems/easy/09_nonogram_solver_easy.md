# Problem Statement

Solve a 5x5 Nonogram puzzle where each cell is either black (1) or white (0). Row and column clues specify groups of consecutive black cells that must appear in each line.

## Instance Data

**Grid:** 5x5 (rows 1-5, columns 1-5)

**Row Clues:**
- Row 1: [2] - one group of 2 consecutive black cells
- Row 2: [1] - one group of 1 black cell
- Row 3: [3] - one group of 3 consecutive black cells
- Row 4: [1, 1] - two groups of 1 black cell each (separated by at least one white cell)
- Row 5: [2] - one group of 2 consecutive black cells

**Column Clues:**
- Column 1: [1, 1] - two groups of 1 black cell each (separated by at least one white cell)
- Column 2: [1, 3] - first one group of 1, then one group of 3 consecutive black cells (separated)
- Column 3: [2] - one group of 2 consecutive black cells
- Column 4: [1] - one group of 1 black cell
- Column 5: [1] - one group of 1 black cell

## Constraints

1. **Grid values**: Each cell must be 0 (white) or 1 (black)
2. **Row clues**: Each row must contain **exactly** the groups specified by its clue, in order
3. **Column clues**: Each column must contain **exactly** the groups specified by its clue, in order
4. **Group separation**: Groups in the same line must be separated by **at least one** white cell
5. **Consecutive groups**: Numbers in clues represent lengths of consecutive black cells

## Objective

Find the unique grid configuration that satisfies **all** row and column clues.

## Output Format

Output JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "grid": [[0, 1, ...], [1, 0, ...], ...],
  "valid": true
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `grid`: 5x5 array where grid[i][j] is 0 (white) or 1 (black) for row i, column j (0-indexed)
- `valid`: boolean, must be true for valid solutions
