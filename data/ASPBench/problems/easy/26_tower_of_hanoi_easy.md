# Problem Statement

Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 4 disks and 3 pegs. Move all disks from peg A to peg C, following the classic rules where only one disk can be moved at a time and larger disks cannot be placed on smaller disks.

## Instance Data

**Disks:** 4 disks numbered 1 (smallest) to 4 (largest)

**Pegs:** A (source), B (auxiliary), C (destination)

**Initial State:**
- Peg A: [4, 3, 2, 1] (bottom to top)
- Peg B: []
- Peg C: []

**Goal State:**
- Peg A: []
- Peg B: []
- Peg C: [4, 3, 2, 1] (bottom to top)

## Constraints

1. **Only one disk** can be moved at a time
2. A disk can **only be moved** from the top of a peg stack
3. A larger disk **cannot be placed** on top of a smaller disk
4. **All disks** must end up on peg C in the same order as they started

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the number of moves required to transfer all disks from peg A to peg C.

**Expected optimal moves: 15** (for 4 disks, the minimum is 2^n - 1 = 15)

## Output Format

```json
{
  "moves": [
    {"step": 1, "disk": 1, "from_peg": "A", "to_peg": "B"},
    {"step": 2, "disk": 2, "from_peg": "A", "to_peg": "C"},
    ...
  ],
  "total_moves": 15,
  "is_optimal": true
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `moves` (array): Sequence of move objects in execution order
  - `step` (integer): Move number, starting from 1
  - `disk` (integer): Disk identifier (1-4)
  - `from_peg` (string): Source peg ("A", "B", or "C")
  - `to_peg` (string): Destination peg ("A", "B", or "C")
- `total_moves` (integer): Total number of moves in the solution
- `is_optimal` (boolean): True if the solution uses the minimum number of moves (15)
