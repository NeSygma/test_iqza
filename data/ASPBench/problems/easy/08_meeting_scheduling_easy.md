# Problem Statement

Schedule 5 meetings over 3 days with optimal room assignment and minimal preference violations. Each meeting has required attendees, and some meetings have preferred time slots.

## Instance Data

**Days:** 3 days (1, 2, 3)
**Time slots per day:** 3 slots (1, 2, 3)
**Rooms:** r1 (conference room), r2 (meeting room)

**Meetings:**
- m1: Project kickoff meeting
- m2: Budget review meeting
- m3: Technical design session
- m4: Client presentation
- m5: Team retrospective meeting

**People:**
- p1: Alice (Project Manager)
- p2: Bob (Developer)
- p3: Carol (Designer)
- p4: Dave (Client)
- p5: Eve (Finance)

**Required Attendees:**
- m1: p1, p2, p3 (Alice, Bob, Carol)
- m2: p1, p5 (Alice, Eve)
- m3: p2, p3 (Bob, Carol)
- m4: p1, p4 (Alice, Dave)
- m5: p1, p2, p3 (Alice, Bob, Carol)

**Time Preferences:**
- m1: day 1, slot 1 (morning kickoff)
- m2: day 1, slot 2 (afternoon budget review)
- m4: day 3, slot 3 (final client presentation)

## Constraints

1. **Each meeting** must be assigned exactly one time slot and one room
2. **No person** can attend two meetings at the same time slot
3. **Only one meeting** per room per time slot
4. **All required attendees** must be available

## Objective

Find a schedule that **minimizes** preference violations (penalty +1 for each meeting not scheduled at its preferred time).

**Expected optimal violations: 0**

## Output Format

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {"meeting": "m1", "day": 1, "slot": 1, "room": "r1"},
    {"meeting": "m2", "day": 1, "slot": 2, "room": "r2"},
    ...
  ],
  "conflicts": [],
  "preference_violations": 0,
  "feasible": true
}
```

**Fields:**
- `schedule`: Array of meeting assignments (meeting ID, day, slot, room)
- `conflicts`: Array of constraint violations (empty if feasible)
- `preference_violations`: Number of meetings not at preferred time
- `feasible`: Boolean indicating if valid schedule exists
