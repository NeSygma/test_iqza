# Problem Statement

Determine if two given graphs are isomorphic by finding a bijection between their vertices that preserves adjacency relationships.

## Instance Data

**Graph 1 (G1)**

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Edges:
- (0, 1)
- (0, 2)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 4)
- (3, 4)

**Graph 2 (G2)**

Vertices: a, b, c, d, e

Edges:
- (a, b)
- (a, c)
- (b, d)
- (c, e)
- (d, e)

## Constraints

1. **Bijection**: There must exist a bijection f: V1 → V2 mapping G1 vertices to G2 vertices
2. **Adjacency preservation**: For **all** edges (u,v) in G1, the mapped edge (f(u),f(v)) **must** exist in G2
3. **Reverse preservation**: For **all** edges in G2, there **must** be a corresponding edge in G1
4. **Degree preservation**: Vertex degrees **must** be preserved under the mapping

## Objective

Determine if the graphs are isomorphic and find the vertex mapping if one exists.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "is_isomorphic": true,
  "mapping": {"0": "a", "1": "b", ...},
  "preserved_edges": [["0,1", "a,b"], ["0,2", "a,c"], ...]
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `is_isomorphic` (boolean): Whether the graphs are isomorphic
- `mapping` (object or null): Vertex mapping from G1 to G2 as strings (null if not isomorphic)
- `preserved_edges` (array): Edge correspondence pairs as [["u,v", "f(u),f(v)"], ...] (empty if not isomorphic)
