# Problem Statement

Determine the winning bids in a combinatorial auction that maximizes total revenue. Bidders submit bids for bundles of items, and each item can be allocated to at most one bidder.

## Instance Data

**Bidders:** A, B, C, D

**Items:** item1, item2, item3, item4, item5

**Bids submitted:**
- Bidder A: {item1, item2} for $100
- Bidder A: {item3} for $50
- Bidder B: {item2, item3} for $120
- Bidder B: {item4, item5} for $80
- Bidder C: {item1, item3, item5} for $150
- Bidder D: {item4} for $40

## Constraints

1. **No conflicts:** Each item may be allocated to **at most one** bidder
2. **Valid bids:** Only submitted bids can win
3. **Bundle integrity:** Winning bids **must** include **all** items in the bundle

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** total revenue from accepted bids.

**Expected optimal revenue:** 230

## Output Format

```json
{
  "winning_bids": [
    {"bidder": "A", "items": ["item1", "item2"], "price": 100},
    ...
  ],
  "total_revenue": 230,
  "item_allocation": {
    "item1": "A",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `winning_bids`: List of accepted bid objects (bidder, items, price)
- `total_revenue`: Sum of prices from winning bids
- `item_allocation`: Map from item to winning bidder (or null if unallocated)
