# Problem Statement

You have a small social network of 8 users connected by friendship links. Each user has an influence weight and a cost to recruit as a "seed" user. Your goal is to select up to 2 seed users within a budget of 300 to maximize the spread of information through the network.

## Instance Data

**Users:**
- user1: influence_weight=0.8, cost=100, category="influencer"
- user2: influence_weight=0.3, cost=50, category="regular"
- user3: influence_weight=0.5, cost=80, category="regular"
- user4: influence_weight=0.9, cost=150, category="influencer"
- user5: influence_weight=0.4, cost=60, category="regular"
- user6: influence_weight=0.6, cost=90, category="regular"
- user7: influence_weight=0.7, cost=120, category="influencer"
- user8: influence_weight=0.2, cost=40, category="regular"

**Connections (directed edges with strength):**
- user1 → user2 (strength=0.6)
- user1 → user3 (strength=0.7)
- user2 → user3 (strength=0.4)
- user2 → user5 (strength=0.5)
- user3 → user4 (strength=0.3)
- user4 → user5 (strength=0.8)
- user4 → user6 (strength=0.6)
- user5 → user7 (strength=0.5)
- user6 → user7 (strength=0.7)
- user7 → user8 (strength=0.4)

**Budget:** 300
**Max Seeds:** 2
**Propagation Model:** threshold

## Constraints

1. **Budget Limit:** The total cost of selected seed users **must not exceed** 300.
2. **Max Seeds:** **At most** 2 users can be selected as seeds.
3. **Direct Influence:** A user is directly influenced if connected from a seed with strength ≥ 0.3.
4. **Secondary Influence:** A user is secondary influenced if connected from a directly influenced user with strength ≥ 0.2 (but not already a seed or directly influenced).
5. **Valid Users:** **All** selected seeds and influenced users must be from the network.

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** the total reach (seeds + directly influenced + secondary influenced users).

**Expected optimal reach: 8**

## Output Format

```json
{
  "selected_seeds": [
    {"user_id": "...", "cost": 100, "expected_reach": 5.2},
    ...
  ],
  "cascade_analysis": {
    "total_budget_used": 250,
    "direct_influence": ["user2", "user3", ...],
    "secondary_influence": ["user5", ...],
    "total_reach": 7,
    "influence_probability": 0.73
  },
  "network_metrics": {
    "coverage_ratio": 0.875,
    "efficiency_score": 2.8,
    "cascade_depth": 3
  }
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `selected_seeds`: List of seed users with their cost and expected reach
  - `user_id`: User identifier
  - `cost`: Cost to recruit this seed
  - `expected_reach`: Expected number of users reached from this seed
- `cascade_analysis`: Information propagation details
  - `total_budget_used`: Total cost of all selected seeds
  - `direct_influence`: List of users directly influenced by seeds
  - `secondary_influence`: List of users influenced by directly influenced users
  - `total_reach`: Total number of users reached (seeds + direct + secondary)
  - `influence_probability`: Probability of successful influence (0-1)
- `network_metrics`: Network coverage statistics
  - `coverage_ratio`: Fraction of network reached (total_reach / total_users, value in 0-1)
  - `efficiency_score`: Reach per unit cost (total_reach / total_budget_used, NOT multiplied by 100)
  - `cascade_depth`: Maximum depth of influence cascade (1-3)

**Important:** The `efficiency_score` is calculated as `total_reach / total_budget_used` without any scaling. For example, if total_reach=7 and total_budget_used=250, then efficiency_score=0.028 (not 2.8).
