# Problem Statement

Analyze a voting scenario with 4 voters and 3 candidates to detect strategic voting behavior. Determine if any voter can improve their outcome by voting differently than their true preferences, and identify the coalition size needed for manipulation.

## Instance Data

**Voters and True Preferences:**
- V1: A > B > C
- V2: A > C > B
- V3: B > C > A
- V4: C > B > A

**Voting System:** Plurality voting (each voter votes for one candidate, highest count wins)

**Current Votes:**
- V1 → A
- V2 → A
- V3 → B
- V4 → C

## Constraints

1. **Winner determination**: The candidate with the most votes wins
2. **Vote counts**: Each voter casts exactly one vote
3. **Strategic opportunity**: A voter benefits if they can change the outcome to a more preferred candidate by voting differently
4. **Condorcet winner**: Identify if a candidate would win all pairwise comparisons
5. **Manipulation detection**: Determine if strategic voting is possible and how many voters must cooperate

## Objective

Find the **minimum coalition size** required for successful strategic manipulation. Determine if any voter or group of voters can achieve a better outcome by deviating from truthful voting.

**Expected optimal coalition size: 2 voters**

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with these fields:

- `election_result`: Election outcome under current votes
  - `winner`: Winning candidate (string)
  - `vote_counts`: Dictionary mapping each candidate to their vote count
  - `total_votes`: Total number of votes cast (integer)
- `strategic_opportunities`: List of manipulation opportunities (may be empty)
  - Each opportunity has:
    - `voter`: Voter identifier (string)
    - `true_preference`: Ordered list of candidates by preference
    - `strategic_vote`: Candidate to vote for strategically (string)
    - `manipulation_detected`: Whether manipulation is possible (boolean)
    - `benefit`: Description of the improvement (string)
- `is_manipulation_proof`: Whether the election is manipulation-proof (boolean)
- `analysis`: Additional analysis
  - `condorcet_winner`: Candidate who wins all pairwise comparisons (string or null)
  - `strategic_voting_present`: Whether strategic opportunities exist (boolean)
  - `voting_paradox`: Type of voting paradox detected (string or null)
  - `min_coalition_size`: Minimum number of voters needed to manipulate (integer)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "election_result": {
    "winner": "A",
    "vote_counts": {"A": 2, "B": 1, "C": 1},
    "total_votes": 4
  },
  "strategic_opportunities": [
    {
      "voter": "V3",
      "true_preference": ["B", "C", "A"],
      "strategic_vote": "B",
      "manipulation_detected": true,
      "benefit": "With V4 cooperation, can elect preferred candidate B over A"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "is_manipulation_proof": false,
  "analysis": {
    "condorcet_winner": null,
    "strategic_voting_present": true,
    "voting_paradox": null,
    "min_coalition_size": 2
  }
}
```
