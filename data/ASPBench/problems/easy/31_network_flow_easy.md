# Problem Statement

Find the maximum flow through a network from source to sink, where each directed edge has a capacity constraint.

## Instance Data

**Network:**
- Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Source: 1
- Sink: 6

**Edges with capacities:**
- 1 → 2: capacity 10
- 1 → 3: capacity 8
- 2 → 3: capacity 5
- 2 → 4: capacity 7
- 3 → 4: capacity 3
- 3 → 5: capacity 9
- 4 → 6: capacity 8
- 5 → 6: capacity 6

## Constraints

1. **Capacity constraint**: Flow on each edge **must not exceed** its capacity
2. **Non-negativity**: Flow on each edge **must be** non-negative
3. **Flow conservation**: For **all** intermediate nodes (not source or sink), total incoming flow **must equal** total outgoing flow

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** the total flow from source to sink.

**Expected optimal value:** max_flow = 14

## Output Format

```json
{
  "max_flow": 14,
  "flows": [
    {"from": 1, "to": 2, "flow": 9},
    {"from": 1, "to": 3, "flow": 5},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `max_flow` (number): Total flow from source to sink
- `flows` (array): List of flow values for each edge
  - `from` (number): Source node of the edge
  - `to` (number): Target node of the edge
  - `flow` (number): Amount of flow on this edge (0 ≤ flow ≤ capacity)
